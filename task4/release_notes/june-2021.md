## Live Preview Task for Persistent Server
Custom tasks have been added for those who want to run a persistent server. Using the provided server log (available with the `--verbose` flag), you can also view the files that are being served.

## Multi-root Support
When in a multi-root workspace, the extension will ask you which workspace to use for the server root. The other workspaces can still be previewed, although they will be treated as an out-of-workspace file. Upon changing workspaces, the embedded preview will auto-redirect if necessary.

## Out-of-workspace Preview
You can now preview outside of a workspace! The server will simply create a custom endpoint for your new server root if necessary.

## Options for Preview Refresh
If you prefer to have less frequent preview refreshes when editing, configure the extension to only refresh on file save or to never automaticall refresh.
